- test state combination with irrelevant locals
- test state combination with gc differences
- step-by-step graph exploration (using some kind of "origin state index" in states)
  - run this and have it be really slow
- vectorize on cpu
  - run this and have it be faster
- future stuff where the order is less clear
  - vectorize on gpu
  - support abstract ranges
